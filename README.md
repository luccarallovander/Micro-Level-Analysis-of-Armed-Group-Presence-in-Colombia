# Micro-Level-Analysis-of-Armed-Group-Presence-in-Colombia

_This quantitative political science project examines whether armed group presence in Colombia‚Äôs municipalities can be better explained by ‚Äúideational‚Äù grievance factors ‚Äî such as political competition and strategic positioning ‚Äî rather than traditional ‚Äúgreed‚Äù factors like resource access._

## üéØ Overview

This study challenges Collier & Hoeffler‚Äôs (2004) finding that ‚Äúgrievance‚Äù factors are unimportant in explaining civil wars.  
Focusing on Colombia (2002‚Äì2011), I test whether the presence of nonstate armed groups (FARC, ELN, AUC) across 1,123 municipalities reflects:

1. **Greed-based incentives** ‚Äî resource maximization through coca cultivation and land quality.  
2. **Grievance-based incentives** ‚Äî ideological and political positioning in municipalities with:
   - Narrow electoral wins, or  
   - Party alternation (anti-incumbent victories).

By operationalizing **grievances as political strategies** rather than structural inequalities, the paper seeks to bridge micro-level civil war analysis and macro-level conflict theory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Research Design
- **Type:** Quantitative micro-level panel analysis (2002‚Äì2011).  
- **Unit of analysis:** Municipality-year (n = 6,732).  
- **Approach:** Logistic regression estimating average marginal effects on the probability of armed group presence.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Theoretical Framework
Traditional ‚Äúgrievance‚Äù measures (e.g., inequality, ethnicity) fail to capture the **ideological project** of armed groups.  
This paper introduces **‚Äúideational‚Äù proxies**:
- **H1:** Narrow-win municipalities ‚Üí higher likelihood of armed group presence.  
- **H2:** Municipalities with party alternation ‚Üí higher likelihood of armed group presence.

Armed groups motivated by ideology (FARC, ELN) are expected to locate strategically in politically contested regions, rather than simply where resources are abundant.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Sources
| Variable | Source |
|-----------|---------|
| Armed group presence | CEDE Panel Dataset (Nieto-Matiz, 2019) |
| Coca crop production | UNODC (2020) |
| Regional election results | Electoral Observation Mission (EOM, 2023) |
| State capacity, population, soil quality | CEDE, AmeriGEO |
| Left-right ideological orientation | Colombian electoral data (2007‚Äì2011) |

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Models
Average marginal effects (AME) are estimated using logistic regression for:
- **Model 1:** Any armed group presence (FARC, ELN, AUC combined)  
- **Models 2‚Äì4:** Group-specific presence for FARC, ELN, AUC

All models control for:
- Population density  
- State capacity  
- Ideological orientation  
- Year fixed effects

## üìà Results

| Predictor | Estimate | Std. Error | Significance |
|------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Coca Crop (Greed) | **+0.39** | 0.02 | *** |
| Soil Quality (Greed) | **+0.02** | 0.005 | ** |
| Regional Elections (Grievance) | +0.03 | 0.01 | * |
| Narrow Win (Grievance) | **+0.06** | 0.02 | ** |
| Party Alternation (Grievance) | +0.01 | 0.01 | ns |

**Key findings:**
- Greed-based predictors (especially coca crop cultivation) remain strong, increasing the probability of armed group presence by **39%**.
- However, **ideational grievance proxies** also show significant effects:
  - Municipalities with **narrow electoral margins** have a **6% higher probability** of armed group presence.
  - FARC presence, in particular, is jointly predicted by both greed and grievance factors.
- AUC and ELN display weaker or mixed results, suggesting divergent strategic logics.

## üß† Interpretation

These findings suggest that armed group behavior in Colombia is **not purely resource-driven**, but **politically strategic**.  
- FARC appears to be guided by an ‚Äúideological project,‚Äù establishing presence where political change is contested or possible.  
- This micro-level evidence contrasts with prior cross-sectional studies that dismissed grievances as unimportant.

Thus, **when grievances are measured ideationally**, rather than structurally, they exhibit explanatory power comparable to economic incentives.
